# Desktop Security Testing Guide (based on OWASP Top 10 Desktop Application Security Risks)

### Description
Although OWASP provides testing guides for web and mobile applications, there is currently no comprehensive, structured methodology for assessing the security of Windows desktop applications. Organizations developing thick-client applications lack vendor-neutral best practices and repeatable testing procedures, leading to inconsistent security assessments and preventable vulnerabilities.

This project addresses the gap between the OWASP Desktop Application Security Top 10 and real-world security testing practice, as well the lack of a proper security testing guide for these applications.

No current OWASP project delivers this as a security testing methodology

### What is the purpose of this Project?
To produce a practical, repeatable, and accessible security testing methodology for Windows desktop applications, designed for penetration testers, red teamers, application security engineers, and software developers interested in creating secure software.


### Project Deliverables*

This project will provide a structured Security Testing Guide (similar format to OWASP WSTG and MSTG) for Desktop (Windows .NET) applications.
- Windows-specific security testing workflows 
- Tools and repeatable test procedures 
- Remediation patterns developers can apply immediately

Covering step-by-step security tests for:
-	Memory analysis
-	Binary & resource inspection
-	DLL hijacking risk validation
-	Local storage and registry security
-	Dependency and SBOM hygiene
